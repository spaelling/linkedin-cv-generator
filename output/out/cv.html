<h3 id="azure-security-hardening">Azure Security Hardening</h3>
<p>Jun 2023-</p>
<p>Customer: Confidential<br>
Role: Advisor, Architect, Engineer<br>
I performed a comprehensive security assessment of an Azure tenant that contained multiple subscriptions and resources, based on the Azure Fast Track security review checklist, to evaluate the security posture of the tenant and identify any gaps or vulnerabilities.<br>
Based on my findings, I suggested a roadmap to remediate all open actions and improve the security level of the tenant. The roadmap focused on using Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Cloud to enhance detection and response capabilities. I also recommended using other Azure security services such as Azure Firewall to gain deeper insight into internal network traffic.<br>
Deliverables: Implementation of roadmap initiated.<br>
Azure services: Defender for Cloud, Sentinel, Azure Policies</p>
<h3 id="azure-network-security">Azure Network Security</h3>
<p>Feb 2023-Apr 2023</p>
<p>Customer: Confidential<br>
Role: Advisor, Architect, Engineer<br>
I provided security advisory and hardening implementations for a major Danish public transport authority that wanted to protect its network infrastructure against cyber threats. I analyzed the current network design and configuration and identified potential security risks and gaps.<br>
Based on my analysis, I implemented Azure Firewall as a central hub firewall that could inspect and filter internal and external network traffic. I used Azure policies to create a security baseline for Network Security Groups to ensure proper micro-segmentation.<br>
Deliverables: Secured network infrastructure using Azure Firewall and Network Security Groups Implemented network security hardening and micro-segmentation Enhanced network protection and traffic filtering using Azure Firewall Enforced a security baseline using Azure policies<br>
Project was ultimately superseded by other security initiative.<br>

<p>Dec 2022-Apr 2023</p>
<p>Customer: VENZO<br>
Role: Developer, Architect, Engineer<br>
This was a project I wanted to do ever since I started in VENZO. After a few years the first iteration was conceived and well received by customers. In the start of 2023 I rewrote the entire engine that synchronizes cost data to support multi-tenancy, highly flexible on where to store the data, and an onboarding process for new customers that can take less than an hour.<br>
I have written all of the code in nodejs, and built the infrastructure to follow just about every single best practice. I use a Azure Service Bus and durable functions to orchestrate synchronizing data daily for multiple tenants, subscriptions.<br>
I helped our Power BI consultants make sense of all the cost data, and eventually ended up making changes to some of the logic in the Power BI report so that it would support retro-active tagging.<br>
Deliverables: Paas based application to continuously export Azure Cost data into SQL database Scripted onboarding of new customers Plug'n'play PowerBI report that is still customizeable retroactive tagging of resources Developed a scalable and flexible Azure cost data synchronization engine using nodejs, Azure Service Bus and durable functions Rewrote the Azure cost data synchronization engine to support multi-tenancy, flexible data storage and fast onboarding service offering that VENZO can provide to customers<br>

<h3 id="automatic-video-aggregation-using-multiple-sources-master-thesis">Automatic Video Aggregation using multiple sources (Master Thesis)</h3>
<p>Sep 2012-Sep 2012</p>
<p>From the abstract of the final report:<br>
&quot;The amount of amateur footage has increased rapidly over the last few years along with the high availability of fast mobile connections and the extensive spread of smartphones. Much of this footage is recorded at specific events, by different people, who later make it available for public viewing on ex. YouTube. We argue that there is an impending demand for a way to au- tomatically aggregate videos related to the same event into summaries. In this project we study the possibilites for automated video summary genera- tion, by assessing video image quality, and identifying contextual properties using ex. optical flow estimation and Haar Cascade Classifiers. Based on these contextual properties we generate video summaries using a custom algorithm. We were able successfully detect ex. public speakers, crowds, police blinker lights, and overview shots, which allowed us to generate video summaries with a solid contextual flow. Our test panel generally provided positive feedback. In this paper we show that generating video summaries is computationaly feasible and that the generated summaries are comparable to human edited summaries.&quot;<br>
Our work spanned many different fields of image analysis. The implementations were done in Python using the Numpy/Scipy libraries as well as OpenCV, and open source computer vision library.</p>
<h3 id="addoapp-back-end-and-cms-system">AddoApp back-end and CMS system</h3>
<p>May 2011-Jul 2012</p>
<p>During the start-up of AddoApp ApS we built this system to function as the data-provider for the AddoApp iOS- and Android- app module code base used to built the apps themselves.<br>
The system is built and hosted as a Google App Engine app for scalability. It consists of a back-end, which:\</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain the data structure needed to for the information, used by the apps. - Facilitates communication between the apps and Facebook. - Provides PUSH message functionality to the apps through the Urban Airship (<a href="http://urbanairship.com">urbanairship.com</a>) service.<br>
The front-end allows AddoApp's customers to:\</li>
<li>See and edit the information currently used by their apps. - Post PUSH messages to select users or entire broadcasts to everyone. - Google Analytics tracking of app use was also in the works, but never fully implemented.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>As a team lead at my time in VENZO i had the pleasure of getting to know Anders. He was and is one of the best Azure architects i have come across in my career.  Anders always takes it to &quot;the next level&quot; in technology. Combined with his deep technical understanding of Azure architecture in general and ability to see alternative solutions in any given scenario, has proven that he can take on any technical task thrown at him and come back with a high quality delivery every single time.  It was a pleasure working with Anders and i truly hope to experience it once again in the future. The tech talks we had, and all that i have learned from him is invaluable. - <em>Jakob Strøm, JBS-Automation, Company Owner</em></li>
<li>Anders Spælling har arbejdet som itkonsulent på Microsoft System Center Service Manager, hvor han hurtigt har sat sig ind i vores opsætning, behov og vilkår. Udover at levere det aftalte, så har han været god til at komme med input til forbedringer og indgået i den løbende dialog i afdelingen om behov, procesændringer m.m., som helt klart har været en fordel. Dette har han helt klart kunne gøre fordi han har haft godt kendskab til produktet, hans evner og vores behov. - <em>Victoria Vorting, Novo Nordisk, Agile People Leader</em></li>
<li>Anders er en god, pålidelig medarbejder. Han er teknisk dygtig, samtidig med at han var istand til at yde god service for brugerne på CBS.   Han er grundig med opgaverne, og sætter sig ind i forhold og muligheder før han løser opgaven, hvilket giver et godt resultat. Han er ikke bange for selv at komme med forslag eller ændringer, som kan gavne kollegaer og slutbrugere. - <em>Victoria Vorting, Novo Nordisk, Agile People Leader</em></li>
